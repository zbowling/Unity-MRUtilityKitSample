# Unity MRUK Sample

This sample project will help you navigate and understand the MR Utility Kit APIs through a collection of samples that. Feel free to delve into these APIs, try them out, and discover creative ways to apply them in your projects.

The [Oculus License](./LICENSE) applies to the samples.

This project was built using the [Unity engine](https://unity.com/download).

## Mixed Reality Utility Kit Overview

MR Utility Kit provides a rich set of utilities and tools on top of Scene API to perform common operations when building spatially-aware apps. This makes it easier to program against the physical world, and allows developers to focus on what makes their app unique.

The utilities provided broadly fall into 3 categories: Scene Queries, Graphical Helpers, Development Tools.

More information on MR Utility Kit can be found on our [developer website](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-mr-utility-kit-overview/).


## Project Structure

- [MRUKBase](./Assets/MRUKSamples/Basic): A basic scene showing the core functionality of MR Utility Kit leveraging the EffectMesh prefab to visualize the scene data.
- [Floor Zone](./Assets/MRUKSamples/FloorZone): A scene showing how to find a floor zone unobstructed by other scene anchors.
- [Multi Spawn](./Assets/MRUKSamples/MultiSpawn): A scene showing how to spawn objects in different locations within the room.
- [Nav Mesh](./Assets/MRUKSamples/NavMesh): A scene showing how to create a nav mesh for navigation leveraging the scene data.
- [Virtual Home](./Assets/MRUKSamples/VirtualHome): A scene showing how to reskin a room using the prefab spawner functionality.
- [Passthrough Relighting](./Assets/MRUKSamples/PassthroughRelighting): A scene showing the effect of virtual shadows and highlights on scene objects.
- [Scene Decorator](./Assets/MRUKSamples/SceneDecorator): A scene with basic decorations and SceneDecorator to populate the environment.
- [Destructible Mesh](./Assets/MRUKSamples/DestructibleMesh): A scene showing how to spawn a global mesh that can be segmented, usually used to create destructible environments.
- [Environment Panel Placement](./Assets/MRUKSamples/EnvironmentPanelPlacement): A scene showing how to use EnvironmentRaycastManager to attach virtual panel to the physical environment.
- [Space Map](./Assets/MRUKSamples/SpaceMap): A scene with the SpaceMap prefab added. It creates a texture which represents the room with a color gradient according to the settings of the prefab.
- [Keyboard Tracking](./Assets/MRUKSamples/KeyboardTracker): A scene demonstrating generic keyboard detection and tracking.
- [Bouncing Ball](./Assets/MRUKSamples/BouncingBall): A scene showing virtual balls interacting with the physical environment.
- [QR Code Detection](./Assets/MRUKSamples/QRCodeDetection): A scene demonstrating QR code detection.
- [HiFi Scene](./Assets/MRUKSamples/HiFiScene): A scene showing multiple floors and ceilings, slanted ceilings, inner walls.
